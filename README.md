Project Dictionary

DESCRIPTION
This is a react app that retrieves data from a third party API.
"https://dictionaryapi.dev/"
When a word is input, the user will be able to find the definitions.
If the user decides to bookmark that word, he can simply click on an icon and it will be saved in a bookmark list.
A list of search history is also available to refer to anytime.
Both lists (bookmark and search history), when word is clicked, it will automatically direct the user to the definition of that selected word.
